      My name is Will, I am an 18 year old computer science major from Somerset, NJ. I first got interested in cs in highschool. I took a couple introductory classes and was hooked. This is an example of what I can do with what i've learned.

       A little bit of information about me: I originally wasn't considering the University at Buffalo but after a recomendation for my guidance counselor and looking into the cs program I decided it was the fit for me. CS is interesting to me because i'm able to build things from scratch as well as solve problems.

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">
      Behind CS another big part of my life is hockey. If you need to know one thing about me its that i love hockey with a passion.
